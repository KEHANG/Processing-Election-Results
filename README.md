Election-Results-Visualization Homework7
========================================

An example on Processing that reads in 2012 US election results and draws them as text.

Functionality
-------------
The color of state will change into the color of the winning candidate. e.g. Obama (always blue) won Vermont, so Vermont is blue; while Romney (always red) won Arizona, so Arizona turns red.

Instructions
------------

1. Download and install [Processing](http://processing.org/download/)
2. Fork/download this repository to your computer
  * If you have a github account, you can fork this with the "fork" button
  * If you want to use your own git repository, you can download this using the "zip" button
3. Open the Election.pde file on your computer with Processing
4. Press the play button to run it

Data
----

The data was sourced from the Guardian Data Blog. Their state data seems accurate, though 
incomplete.  Their county data looked suspicious to me.  Good enough for this playground.
